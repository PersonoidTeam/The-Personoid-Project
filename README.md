# The Personoid Project
An open-source project aimed at introducing life-like Minecraft characters to a server.

## When will it release?
When it's ready! There are a lot of systems to design for a project as huge as this, so we want spend time making it as robust as possible.

## What exactly is it?
It's a single .jar file - to be precise, a Minecraft plugin. All you need to do it put it in your 'plugins' folder and it'll work!

## Where can I download the plugin when it's done?
We're not sure yet, but it's likely to be published on most major plugin websites, maybe even our own.
